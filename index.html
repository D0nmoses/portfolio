    <h2>Some of the projects I've been involved in include the following:</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <a href="https://github.com/D0nmoses/cookie-recipe"><img src="images/cookies.jpeg" class="project_img" /></a>
      <p>This project offered a
        great lesson on how bad spacing and indentation could affect the readaility of code. The current version has
        code written with care towards indentatin and spacing.It was coded entirely in HTML.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <a href="https://github.com/D0nmoses/giraffe"><img src="images/giraffe.jpeg" class="project_img" /></a>
      <p>This project offered my first crash course into using CSS classes to format multiple related elements rather
        than either one at a time or all similarly named elements.It was coded in HTML and CSS.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <a href="https://github.com/D0nmoses/travel_agency"><img src="images/travel.jpeg" class="project_img" /></a>
      <p>This project built on use of css classes while also introducing me to div and span elements to group other
        elements together for collective manipulation. It was coded in HTML and CSS.</p>
