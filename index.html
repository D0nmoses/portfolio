      <p>This project offered a
        great lesson on how bad spacing and indentation could affect the readaility of code. The current version has
        code written with care towards indentatin and spacing.It was coded entirely in HTML.</p>

      <p>This project offered my first crash course into using CSS classes to format multiple related elements rather
        than either one at a time or all similarly named elements.It was coded in HTML and CSS.</p>

      <p>This project built on use of css classes while also introducing me to div and span elements to group other
        elements together for collective manipulation. It was coded in HTML and CSS.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Don Moses is a student at Moringa School studying software development. He is 22 years old and hopes to become
        proficient at programming effectively rather than a jumbled mess. He is most familiar with Python language with
        a background in data science studies but lack of a deeper understanding in its use towards object oriented
        programming or rather, software development. His hobbies including reading <em>long</em> books, gaming and a
        healthy nap. He has had previous education at Moringa school studying machine learning and at Strathmore
        University studying computer science and data science.</p><br>
      <p>He decided to join Moringa school to gain a better understanding of the software development life cycle as he
        felt it would be a great addition to previous ventures and also make him more receptive of working in teams of
        coders with a view of a future entailed in working with other coders. He wishes that the experience will be
        worth it in the end.</p><br>
